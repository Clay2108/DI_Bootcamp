//Answer#1

let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 21;

//console.log(a+b) //first expression

// 1.What will be the outcome of a + b in the first expression ?
// Prediction: It will output 55, because 34 and 21 are numbers
// Actual: 55

a = 2;

//console.log(a+b) //second expression
//2. What will be the outcome of a + b in the second expression ?
// Prediction: It will output 23, because new value has been reassigned to a =2 and b remains 21
// Actual:23


// 3.What is the value of c?
//console.log (c)
Actual: undefined //because it has no value

//4.Analyse the code below, what will be the outcome?
console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
Actual:75 //because its a concatenation
